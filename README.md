Overview
This project focuses on performing time series forecasting . It utilizes various Python libraries for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:

pandas: A powerful data manipulation library, used for handling data in tabular form.
numpy: A library for numerical operations, essential for working with arrays and performing mathematical functions.
matplotlib: A popular plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib, which provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative graphics.
statsmodels: Provides classes and functions for the estimation of statistical models, including time series forecasting with the Holt-Winters method.
Loading the Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in an Excel file. Here's how the data is loaded:
python
Copy
Edit
Checking for Duplicate Entries
To ensure data integrity, the project checks for any duplicate entries in each column of the dataset:
Checking for Missing Values
To ensure the completeness of the dataset, the code checks for any missing (null) values in each column:
Renaming Columns
# Renaming the column
df.rename(columns={"Unnamed: 0": "DATE"}, inplace=True)
This code renames the "Unnamed: 0" column to "DATE", making it more meaningful and easier to work with in subsequent steps.
Creating a 'Month-Year' Column
python
Copy
Edit
# New 'Month-Year' column
df['Month-Year'] = df['DATE'].dt.strftime('%B %Y')  # Format as 'Month Year'

# Verify
print(df[['DATE', 'Month-Year']].head())
I created a new column "Month-Year" by formatting the "DATE" column to show the full month name and year, making it easier to analyze data on a monthly basis.

Fitting the Holt-Winters Model and Forecasting

# Fit the model
model = ExponentialSmoothing(df_monthly['TOTAL VALUE'], trend='add')
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast the next 3 months
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=3)
This code fits an Exponential Smoothing model (Holt-Winters) to the "TOTAL VALUE" column with an additive trend. After fitting the model,
it forecasts the next 3 months, providing predictions for future values based on historical data.

Creating a Rolling Average for Forecasting
# Applying a rolling average to forecast
df_monthly['forecast'] = df_monthly['TOTAL VALUE'].rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()
The code creates a rolling average on the "TOTAL VALUE" column with a window size of 3 months. 
The min_periods=1 ensures that the average is calculated even if fewer than 3 months are available, helping to smooth out short-term fluctuations in the data.
